# Estimated and actual hours worked

## Overview
| Name | Stuff | Estimated hrs | Actual hrs |
| Jay Patel | CSS UI | 1 | 1.25 |
| Arnav Jain | Bug testing + documentation | 1 | 1 |
| Brett Balquist | Main code structure + bug testing + documentation | 1.25 | 1 |
| Tej Gumaste | Game logic | 1.5 | 1.5 |
| Daniel Neugent | Core engine | 2 | 1.5 |

Note: All people had an extra 1.5 hours due to weekly meetings

## Estimates
Jay's estimate: Finniky nature of CSS and difficulty with UI lead to an estimate of 1hr
Arnav's estimation: Documentation can take a while so 45m + 15m of bug testing
Brett's estimation: Main code structure takes 15m, bug testing takes 15m, and documentation takes 45m
Tej's estimation: Game logic is a bit difficult and should take around 2 hours, but his familiarity with math and JavaScript, he should be able to do it faster so 1.5hrs
Daniel's estimation: Creating the engine and rendering mechanism can also be a bit hard. Moreso though is (once again) the UI, but Daniel's familiarity with JavaScript had us estimate 2hrs. 

## Actual

Brett 09/09: Spent 30m getting the REPO ready and making a skeleton for the page and also writing documentation
Daniel 09/10: Spent 1.5hrs writing the main game engine. His work was shorter than expected since he was essentially working from scratch. There was no overhead of getting used to someone else's code
Tej 09/10: Spent 1.5hrs writing the game logic. This estimation was perfect because it took into account his skill level with JS and familiarity with making games to write the main game engine.
Jay 09/10: Ended up taking a bit longer as he was a bit unfamiliar with the codebase, but was able to crank out the UI in about 1hr and 15 mins. Making it "nice" was harder than expected but was finished.
Arnav Jain 09/10: Spent <5 minutes testing for any bugs. One was found which was fixed rather quickly. He also added a shake effect upon hitting a bomb. Took about 10m total which was shorter than expected. There were less bugs than initially believed.
Daniel 09/11: <5m making the code a bit more readable
Brett 09/12: Put final touches, bug tested, documentation, etc. Essentially took on the reviewer role. Took around 30m so around 1hr total. Again, bug testing was faster than believed
Arnav 9/21: Wrote the rest of the documentation. This took much longer than expected. The level of detail needed was more than what was thought while writing the estimation. This took around 50m. However, the total (documentation + bug testing) was equal to the estimate so it balanced out.
